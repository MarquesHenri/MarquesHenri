Hello!! My name is Henrique and I'm gonna tell you a bit about me.

  I'm 19, I live in Brazil and I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering (2nd year). I love puzzles and logics so I decided to give being a backend programmer a try.
  Right now, I'm still working hard to learn the basics and improving my skills to land a job, but I will showcase my progress and enhancements through my GitHub!

Languages:
  - Brazilian portuguese (native)
  - English (advanced c1/c2)
     - Note: I'm not using a translator to write this file :)

Programming Languages:
  - Python (I've learned the basics and have started to create small projects with it)
  - C (Just the basics for now)
  - Java (A future goal I want to achieve after improving my skill further)

VCS(Version Control System):
  - Git
